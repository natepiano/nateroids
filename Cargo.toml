#
# todo: rust question - bevy-inspector-egui explicilty asks for the "manage-clipboard" feature from bevy_egui
#                       however this feature breaks the wasm build so that i have to disable it
#                       as follows - IMO this is unnessary because i've configured bevy-inspector-egui
#                       code to not compile in release with #[cfg(debug_assertions)] but i want to be able
#                       to just cargo run and get dev stuff and cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
#                       without the extra rigamarole...is there a better way to do this?
# RUSTFLAGS="--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis" cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
